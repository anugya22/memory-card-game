Memory card Game.

How to play
The js function used in the Html file will randomize the emoji's position in the card, and when you click on one card you will have to find the same card the second time.
If you do the the points increase by one.

CODE
The CSS AND JS are both incorporated in one code of the HTML file.
This is purely made by HTML AND JS and does not have any backend or storage.
This is only the frontend, and each time you refresh, the pattern/position of emojis change.
